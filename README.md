## Getting Started

To enhance your learning experience, virtual machines (VMs) have been configured for you to run and test the scripts using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).
The provided Vagrant file simplifies VM management.

1. **Install Vagrant:**
   If you haven not installed Vagrant, download it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) 
   and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Optionally, for a graphical user interface, run the scripts in an Ubuntu VM instead of Vagrant and 
   access the website at localhost:900 in your web browser.
2. **Install Docker:**

   **For Windows:**
   - Install Docker Desktop by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows/).

   **For Linux:**
   - Install Docker Engine by following the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux/).

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone this repository to your local machine to obtain the scripts and the Vagrant file.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/odennav/nginx-card.git
   cd nginx-earth
   ```

4. **Access the VM:**
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh cool
   ```

5. **Practice with the Scripts:**

   Open a script file with a text editor of your choice, and type out every line of code for hands-on learning and to understand how it works

6. **Download HTML template from Tooplate.com and extract webfiles to working directory**:
   ```bash
   bash get_html.sh
   ```
7. **Automate deployment of highway website run with docker containers**:
   ```bash
   bash nginx_card_deploy.sh
   ```

## Clean Up Deployment(Optional)
   **Delete docker images and containers used to host nginx website**:
   ```bash
   bash clean_up.sh 
   ```
## Contribution Guidelines
   If you have your own scripts or improvements, feel free to contribute! Suggestions and enhancements are welcome.

Happy Scripting!
